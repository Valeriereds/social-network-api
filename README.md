# social-network-api

## Description

This Social Network API was made to test my ever-growing knowledge on NOSQL, insomnia, and node. I ran into a few issues with my user and thought controllers, as well as my routes for adding/deleting friends, and adding/deleting reactions. I think the error was caused with my syntax inputting the localhost url, and unfortunately at the time of submitting, I've only figured out my thoughts/user routes. But hopefully, with time and expertise, I can come back to this challenge with more knowledge on how to conquer it. I hope whomever stumbles on this humble app will feel free to leave any dev notes they might have as well.

## Usage

To test the application, simply type "npm install" into the integrated terminal, then "npm start" or "node index.js" to start the server. Then open insomnia to test the routes! Happy Coding!
